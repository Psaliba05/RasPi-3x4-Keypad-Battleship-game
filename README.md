Description of our game:
We wanted to create a replica of the famous game "Battleship". Where two players with a 9x9 grid with 7 ships play to shoot down eachothers ships with a randomly generated grid. The point of the game is to blindly choose an X and Y coordinate and see if you hit your opponents ship. If not, you will switch turns until all ships from one player has been sunk.
